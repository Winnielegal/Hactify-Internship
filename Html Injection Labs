# Lab 1 - HTML Injection

Welcome to Lab 1 of the HTML Injection series at Hactify! This lab will introduce you to HTML Injection, a vulnerability commonly found in web applications.

## About HTML Injection

HTML Injection is a vulnerability that occurs in web applications, allowing users to insert HTML code via a specific parameter or entry point. Unlike Cross-site Scripting (XSS), HTML Injection only allows the injection of certain HTML tags. When an application fails to properly handle user-supplied data, attackers can inject valid HTML code, typically via a parameter value, to insert their own content into the page.

### Severity
- The severity of HTML Injection is categorized as a P4 bug with a CVSS score of 0.1-3.9, which is Low. However, in cases of account takeover, it can be categorized as P3.

### Exploiting HTML Injection
1. Test every entry point on a target website.
2. Refer to the HTML Injection Documentation.
3. Check for valid HTML Injection onto the screen.
